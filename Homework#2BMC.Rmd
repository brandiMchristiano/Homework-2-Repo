                                  Challenge #1
                               ------------------
```{r}
f <-"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/difiore/ADA-datasets/master/IMDB-movies.csv"
d <- read.csv(f)
d
```

 -  Use a one-line statement to filter the dataset to include just movies from 1920 to 1979 and movies that are between 1 and 3 hours long (runtimeMinutes >= 60 and runtimeMinutes <= 180), and add a new column that codes the startYear into a new variable, decade (“20s,” “30s,” …“70s”). If you do this correctly, there should be 5651 movies remaining in the dataset.
 
 
```{r}
s <- filter(d,)
```
